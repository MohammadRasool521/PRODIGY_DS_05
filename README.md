# Title : Traffic Accident Data

In this traffic data analysis project, we undertook a comprehensive examination of the accident records, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization. Here are the key findings and observations from the analysis:

City-wise Accident Distribution:

Miami stands out as the city with the highest number of accidents. This could be attributed to its high population density and traffic volume. On the other hand, Star Junction and Stromsburg are among the cities with the least number of accidents, possibly due to their smaller size and lower traffic.

State-wise Accident Distribution:

California reports the highest number of accident cases, which aligns with its large population and extensive road network. Conversely, South Dakota (SD) has the least number of accident cases, likely due to its lower population density and traffic volume.

Yearly Accident Rates:

The year 2021 recorded the highest accident rates, indicating a potential increase in traffic or changes in reporting during this period.
